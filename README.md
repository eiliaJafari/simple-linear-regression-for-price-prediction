# simple-linear-regression-for-price-prediction
A simple linear regression model to predict the sale prices for some houses

### In this project I used the Ames Housing dataset. The goal is to create a Linear Regression Model, train it on the data with the optimal parameters using a grid search, and then evaluate the model's capabilities on a test set.

* I only used Numpy, Pandas and Scikit learn
